# Transformer Architecture In LLMs

## Traditional Transformer
> The `Transformer` architecture consists of stacked `encoder` and `decoder` layers, each containing **two** main sub-layers: the `multi-head attention` mechanism and t`he position-wise feed-forward network` (FFN).

### Basics
**Multi-Head Attention Mechanism**: The attention mechanism allows the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence when generating each element of the output sequence.

**Scaled Dot-Product Attention**: The core attention mechanism in Transformers is the scaled dot-product attention, which is defined as:

$$\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V$$

Where for a single attention head with input sequence X ∈ \\(ℝ^{(n×d)}\\):

- **\\(Q\\) (Query)** = \\(XW_q\\) ∈ \\(ℝ^{(n×d_k)}\\)
- **\\(K\\) (Key)** = \\(XW_k\\) ∈ \\(ℝ^{(n×d_k)}\\)
- **\\(V\\) (Value)** = \\(XW_v\\) ∈ \\(ℝ^{(n×d_v)}\\)
- **\\(W_q\\), \\(W_k\\)** ∈ \\(ℝ^{(d×d_k)}\\) and **\\(W_v\\)** ∈ \\(ℝ^{(d×d_v)}\\) are learnable parameter matrices
- **\\(d_k\\)** is the dimension of the key vectors
- **\\(n\\)** is the sequence length
- **\\(d\\)** is the model dimension (embedding dimension)

The computation flow is:

1. Matrix multiplication \\(QK^T\\) produces a matrix ∈ \\(ℝ^{(n×n)}\\)
2. Division by \\(\sqrt{d_k}\\) scales the dot products to have appropriate variance
3. Softmax normalizes each row to sum to 1, giving an attention weight matrix ∈ \\(ℝ^{(n×n)}\\)
4. Multiplying by \\(V\\) gives weighted values ∈ \\(ℝ^{(n×d_v)}\\)

**Multi-Head Attention**: The Transformer uses multiple attention heads in parallel, which allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces:

$$\text{MultiHead}(X) = \text{Concat}(\text{head}_1, \text{head}_2, ..., \text{head}_h)W^O$$
$$\text{where head}_i = \text{Attention}(XW^Q_i, XW^K_i, XW^V_i)$$

With the following dimensions:
- **\\(h\\)** is the number of attention heads (typically 8 in the original paper)
- **\\(W^Q_i\\), \\(W^K_i\\)** ∈ \\(ℝ^{(d×d_k)}\\), **\\(W^V_i\\)** ∈ \\(ℝ^{(d×d_v)}\\) where \\(d_k\\) = \\(d_v\\) = \\(d/h\\)
- **\\(W^O\\)** ∈ \\(ℝ^{(hd_v×d)}\\) is the output projection matrix
- Each **\\(head_i\\)** ∈ \\(ℝ^{(n×d_v)}\\)
- **Concat(\\(head_1\\), ..., \\(head_h\\))** ∈ \\(ℝ^{(n×hd_v)}\\)
- Final output ∈ \\(ℝ^{(n×d)}\\)

For instance, in the smallest `GPT-2` model:
- Model dimension d = 768
- Number of heads h = 12
- Head dimension \\(d_k\\) = \\(d_v\\) = 64 (768/12)
- Output projection matrix \\(W^O\\) ∈ \\(ℝ^{(768×768)}\\)


**Position-wise Feed-Forward Network (FFN)**: After the attention mechanism, each position in the sequence is processed independently through the FFN:

$$\text{FFN}(x) = \max(0, xW_1 + b_1)W_2 + b_2$$

Where for each position x ∈ \\(ℝ^d\\):
- **\\(W_1\\)** ∈ \\(ℝ^{(d×d_{ff})}\\) is the weight matrix for the first linear transformation
- **\\(b_1\\)** ∈ \\(ℝ^{(d_{ff})}\\) is the bias vector for the first linear transformation
- **\\(W_2\\)** ∈ \\(ℝ^{(d_{ff}×d)}\\) is the weight matrix for the second linear transformation
- **\\(b_2\\)** ∈ \\(ℝ^d\\) is the bias vector for the second linear transformation
- **\\(d_{ff}\\)** is the inner-layer dimensionality (typically 2048 or 4d)

For the entire sequence X ∈ \\(ℝ^{(n×d)}\\):
- Input to FFN ∈ \\(ℝ^{(n×d)}\\)
- After first linear transformation ∈ \\(ℝ^{(n×d_{ff})}\\)
- After activation function ∈ \\(ℝ^{(n×d_{ff})}\\)
- Output after second linear transformation ∈ \\(ℝ^{(n×d)}\\)

Some implementations use GELU instead of ReLU as the activation function:

$$\text{FFN}(x) = \text{GELU}(xW_1 + b_1)W_2 + b_2$$

The FFN can be viewed as **two convolutions** with kernel size 1 and is applied identically to each position, but with different parameters from layer to layer 

**Layer Normalization and Residual Connections**: Each sub-layer (attention and FFN) in the Transformer includes a residual connection followed by layer normalization:

$$X' = \text{LayerNorm}(X + \text{MultiHead}(X))$$
$$Z = \text{LayerNorm}(X' + \text{FFN}(X'))$$

Where X, X', Z ∈ \\(ℝ^{(n×d)}\\)

**Complete Transformer Layer**: A `single Transformer layer` processes an input X ∈ \\(ℝ^{(n×d)}\\) through:
1. Multi-head attention: X → X' ∈ \\(ℝ^{(n×d)}\\)
2. Layer normalization and residual connection: X, X' → X'' ∈ \\(ℝ^{(n×d)}\\)
3. Feed-forward network: X'' → X''' ∈ \\(ℝ^{(n×d)}\\)
4. Layer normalization and residual connection: X'', X''' → output ∈ \\(ℝ^{(n×d)}\\)

### Stacked Encoder-Decoder

> The `Transformer` architecture consists of a stack of `encoder layers` and a stack of `decoder layers` working in tandem to transform an input sequence into an output sequence. This design enables the model to capture complex patterns and dependencies across sequences of varying lengths.

#### Encoder Stack

The encoder transforms an input sequence into a continuous representation that captures its semantic content. This representation is then used by the decoder to generate the output sequence.

**Input Processing**: For an input sequence of tokens \\(w_1, w_2, \ldots, w_n\\), we first convert each token to an embedding vector. If we denote the `embedding function` as \\(E\\), the initial representation becomes:

$$X^0 = \begin{bmatrix} E(w_1) \\\ E(w_2) \\\ \vdots \\\ E(w_n) \end{bmatrix} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$$

Since Transformers don't have a built-in notion of token order, we add positional encodings to these embeddings. The positional encoding for position `pos` and dimension `i` is defined as:

$$PE_{(pos,2i)} = \sin\left(\frac{pos}{10000^{2i/d}}\right)$$
$$PE_{(pos,2i+1)} = \cos\left(\frac{pos}{10000^{2i/d}}\right)$$

These positional encodings are added to the token embeddings to form the actual input to the encoder:

$$X^{0} _{pos} = E(w _{pos}) + PE _{pos} \in \mathbb{R}^{d}$$

The complete input matrix becomes $$X^0 \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$$ where each row incorporates both token and positional information.

Encoder Layer Computation

Each encoder layer `l` (where \\(l \in \{1, 2, \ldots, L_{enc}\}\\)) processes its input \\(X^{l-1}\\) through two main sub-layers: multi-head self-attention and a feed-forward network. The mathematical formulation for the l-th encoder layer is:

$$X^{l}_{\text{att}} = \text{MultiHead}(X^{l-1}, X^{l-1}, X^{l-1})$$

$$X^{l}_{\text{mid}}=\text{LayerNorm}(X^{l-1} + X^{l} _{\text{att}})$$

$$X^{l}_{\text{ffn}} = \text{FFN}(X^{l} _{\text{mid}})$$

$$X^{l} = \text{LayerNorm}(X^{l} _{\text{mid}} + X^{l} _{\text{ffn}})$$

The multi-head attention in the encoder allows each position to attend to all positions in the previous layer. For the \\(l\\)-th layer, this computation involves using the output of the previous layer \\(X^{l-1}\\) as the queries, keys, and values for the self-attention mechanism.

Stacked Encoder

The encoder comprises \\(L_{enc}\\) identical layers stacked on top of each other. Each layer processes the output of the previous layer, creating increasingly abstract representations of the input sequence. The final output of the encoder stack, \\(X^{L_{enc}} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}\\), serves as the key and value for the cross-attention mechanism in the decoder.

The transformation through the encoder stack can be represented recursively as:

$$X^{l} = \text{EncoderLayer}_l(X^{l-1})$$

Where \\(X^0\\) is the input embedding plus positional encoding, and \\(X^{L_{enc}}\\) is the final encoder output.

#### Decoder Stack

The decoder generates the output sequence element by element, using both the encoder's output and the previously generated elements.

Decoder Input and Masking

For auto-regressive generation, the decoder takes as input the previously generated sequence. During training, this is the target sequence shifted right by one position and prepended with a start token. Like the encoder, these tokens are embedded and combined with positional encodings:

$$
Y^0 = \begin{bmatrix} E(y_0) + PE_0 \\\ E(y_1) + PE_1 \\\ \vdots \\\ E(y_{m-1}) + PE_{m-1} \end{bmatrix} \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times d}
$$

Where \\(y_0\\) is the start token, and \\(m\\) is the length of the output sequence.

Decoder Layer Computation

Each decoder layer \\(l\\) (where \\(l \in \{1, 2, \ldots, L_{dec}\}\\)) consists of three sub-layers: masked multi-head self-attention, cross-attention with the encoder output, and a feed-forward network. The mathematical formulation for the \\(l\\)-th decoder layer is:

$$Y^{l} _{\text{self-att}} = \text{MaskedMultiHead}(Y^{l-1}, Y^{l-1}, Y^{l-1})$$

$$Y^{l} _{\text{mid1}} = \text{LayerNorm}(Y^{l-1} + Y^{l} _{\text{self-att}})$$

$$Y^{l} _{\text{cross-att}} = \text{MultiHead}(Y^{l} _{\text{mid1}}, X^{L _{enc}}, X^{L _{enc}})$$

$$Y^{l} _{\text{mid2}} = \text{LayerNorm}(Y^{l} _{\text{mid1}} + Y^{l} _{\text{cross-att}})$$

$$Y^{l} _{\text{ffn}} = \text{FFN}(Y^{l} _{\text{mid2}})$$

$$Y^{l} = \text{LayerNorm}(Y^{l} _{\text{mid2}} + Y^{l} _{\text{ffn}})$$

The masked multi-head attention employs a lower triangular mask to ensure that when predicting the token at position \\(i\\), the model can only use information from positions \\(< i\\). This is implemented by applying a mask \\(M\\) to the attention weights:

$$M_{ij} = \begin{cases} 0 & \text{if } i \geq j \\\ -\infty & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}$$

The attention scores then become:

$$\text{MaskedAttention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T + M}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V$$

The cross-attention mechanism allows the decoder to focus on relevant parts of the input sequence. In this sub-layer, the queries come from the decoder's previous sub-layer, while the keys and values come from the encoder's output.

Similar to the encoder, the decoder consists of \\(L_{dec}\\) identical layers stacked on top of each other. The transformation through the decoder stack can be represented recursively as:

$$Y^{l} = \text{DecoderLayer} _l(Y^{l-1}, X^{L _{enc}})$$

Where \\(Y^0\\) is the shifted target sequence embedding plus positional encoding, and \\(Y^{L_{dec}} \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times d}\\) is the final decoder output.

#### Final Output Layer

The final decoder output is transformed into probabilities over the vocabulary through a linear projection followed by a softmax function:

$$P(y_i | y_{<i}, X) = \text{softmax}(Y^{L_{dec}} _i W _{\text{out}} + b _{\text{out}})$$

Where \\(W_{\text{out}} \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times |V|}\\) and \\(b_{\text{out}} \in \mathbb{R}^{|V|}\\) are the output projection parameters, and \\(|V|\\) is the vocabulary size.




## Mixture of Experts (MoE)

The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture enhances transformer models by introducing conditional computation, where specialized subnetworks ("experts") are dynamically selected per token. This approach maintains computational efficiency while scaling model capacity.

### Core Components and Mathematics

**Base Transformer Recap**:  
In a standard transformer layer, the feed-forward network (FFN) processes all tokens identically. For an input token \\(x \in \mathbb{R}^d\\), the FFN is:

$$
\text{FFN}(x) = W_2 \cdot \text{GELU}(W_1 x + b_1) + b_2
$$

where \\(W_1 \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times 4d}\\), \\(W_2 \in \mathbb{R}^{4d \times d}\\), \\(b_1 \in \mathbb{R}^{4d}\\), and \\(b_2 \in \mathbb{R}^d\\).

**MoE Layer**:  
The MoE layer replaces the FFN with \\(E\\) experts and a router. For a token \\(x_i \in \mathbb{R}^d\\):

1. **Router**: Computes routing probabilities over experts:  
   $$
   g(x_i) = \text{softmax}(x_i W_r) \in \mathbb{R}^E
   $$  
   where \\(W_r \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times E}\\) is the router’s weight matrix. The top-\\(k\\) experts (typically \\(k=1\\) or \\(2\\)) are selected based on these probabilities.

2. **Experts**: Each expert \\(j\\) is an FFN:  
   $$
   \text{Expert} _j(x_i) = W _{2,j} \cdot \text{GELU}(W _ {1,j} x_i + b _{1,j}) + b _{2,j}
   $$  

   where \\(W_{1,j} \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times m}\\), \\(W_{2,j} \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times d}\\), and \\(m\\) is the hidden dimension (often \\(m=4d\\)). Experts share the same architecture but have independent parameters.

3. **Combination**: The final output is a weighted sum of the selected experts:  
   $$
   \text{MoE}(x_i) = \sum_{j \in \mathcal{T}_i} g(x_i)_j \cdot \text{Expert}_j(x_i)
   $$  
   where \\(\mathcal{T}_i\\) is the set of top-\\(k\\) expert indices for token \\(x_i\\).

### Load Balancing and Capacity

**Expert Capacity**: To prevent overloading individual experts, each processes at most \(C\) tokens per batch:  
$$
C = \left\lceil \frac{\alpha \cdot B \cdot n}{E} \right\rceil
$$  
where \\(B\\) is the batch size, \\(n\\) is the sequence length, and \\(\alpha \geq 1\\) is a buffer factor.

**Load Balancing Loss**: A regularization term ensures uniform expert utilization:  
$$
\mathcal{L} _{\text{balance}} = \lambda \cdot E \cdot \sum _{j=1}^E f_j \cdot p_j
$$  

where \\(f_j\\) is the fraction of tokens routed to expert \\(j\\), \\(p_j\\) is the mean routing probability for expert \\(j\\), and \\(\lambda\\) is a hyperparameter (typically \\(0.01\\)).

### Sparse Computation

**Activation Sparsity**: Only \\(k\\) experts per token are activated. For a batch of \\(B \cdot n\\) tokens, the MoE layer computes:  
- Router logits: \\(B \cdot n \cdot E\\) operations  
- Expert computations: \\(B \cdot n \cdot k \cdot (2dm + m + d)\\) operations  

This contrasts with a dense FFN’s \\(B \cdot n \cdot (2dm + m + d)\\) operations. MoE scales model size (via \\(E\\)) without linearly increasing computation.

### Advanced Variants

**Switch Transformer**: Uses \(k=1\) for simplicity. The routing equation reduces to:  
$$
j^* = \arg\max_j (x_i W_r)_j
$$  

and only \\(\text{Expert}_{j^*}\\) processes \\(x_i\\).

**Expert Choice Routing**: Experts select tokens instead of tokens selecting experts. For expert \\(j\\):  
$$
\mathcal{S}_j = \text{top-}C \text{ tokens by } x_i W_r^j
$$  

where \\(W_r^j \in \mathbb{R}^d\\) is the expert-specific routing vector.

**Hierarchical MoE**: Organizes experts into groups. A token is first routed to a group, then to an expert within the group, reducing the effective routing dimension.

### Implementation Challenges

**Distributed Training**: Experts are sharded across devices. Tokens are routed via all-to-all communication, which introduces overhead proportional to \\(E\\).

**Memory Footprint**: Storing \\(E\\) experts increases memory use by \\(E \times\\) compared to a dense layer. Techniques like expert parameter offloading or quantization mitigate this.

**Convergence Stability**: The interation between router gradients and expert training requires careful tuning of optimizer settings (e.g., higher learning rates for routers).
