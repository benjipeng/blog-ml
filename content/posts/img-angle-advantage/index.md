## A Gentle Intro

> If you are new, here, we embrace a tool-agnostic approach, which ensures universality in prompt creation, empowering us to transcend specific platforms while crafting precise visual narratives.

### Composition

Generally you can construct your prompt like

>  `{compositoonal type}, {subject of your composition}, {whatever may not be covered}, {background, context, or whatever else fills out your composition}`.

More details on composition is beyond the scope of this article, but will be re-visited in the future.

### Context or Details

When formulating prompts for image generation models, **clarity** is paramount. Consider adding the following dimensions to your prompt to refine your vision:

- **Subject**: Whether it's a person, animal, location, character, or object, specificity in the main subject can drive more accurate outputs.
- **Medium**: Envision the final product. Would you prefer a photo, painting, illustration, sculpture, doodle, or even a tapestry?
- **Environment**: Contextualize the setting. Is it indoors, outdoors, perhaps on the moon, submerged underwater, or within the whimsical realms of Narnia or the Emerald City?
- **Lighting**: Describe the illumination. Opt for soft ambient, the moodiness of overcast, the vibrancy of neon, or the professionalism of studio lights.
- **Color Palette**: What tones resonate with your vision? Whether it's vibrant, muted, bright, monochromatic, colorful, black and white, or pastel, your choice can significantly impact the mood.
- **Mood**: Reflect on the emotion you wish to convey. It could range from the tranquility of sedate and calm to the dynamism of raucous and energetic atmospheres.
- **Composition**: Lastly, the framing and focus, be it a portrait, headshot, closeup, or even a bird's-eye view, play an integral role in your final masterpiece.

### The Tools Used in This Guide

All the images below are generated using the SDXL model. The machine I used is a `Macbook Pro` with `M1 Pro` chip (16GB unified memory).
 
SDXL generally does an *okay* job comparing to its predecessors, my `negative prompts` are quite simple: `((out of focus)), watermark, artist name, deformed`.

## Very Simple Camera Control

**This image is a little ... *complicated*, its actually `full-body shot`, and `Ultra-wide` combined. Also, you may need to adjust the `size` (aspect ratio) of your `canvas` to make sure your human subject is not cropped (a lot of trials an errors) ðŸ˜¬**
