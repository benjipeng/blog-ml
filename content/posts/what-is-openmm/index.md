[OpenMMLab](https://openmmlab.com/) serves as **a collection of toolkits and frameworks** for a wide range of **_computer vision (CV)_** tasks, _ie_. object detection, semantic segmentation, pose estimation, and optical character recognition (OCR). Built on top of `PyTorch`, it has become one of the most popular and influential repositories for computer vision, bridging the gap between academic research and industrial applications. Check out the [OpenMMLab Github](https://github.com/open-mmlab)

## Core Components of `OpenMMLab`

{{< alert "fire" >}}
**MMDetection**: A versatile toolbox for _object detection_ and _instance segmentation_. It supports a wide array of models, including `Faster R-CNN`, `YOLO`, and `RetinaNet`, allowing easy customization and training on custom datasets. MMDetection is a go-to framework for researchers and practitioners working on tasks like autonomous driving, security, and more.

**MMSegmentation**: `Semantic segmentation` component by supporting state-of-the-art (SOTA) models and facilitates experiments with various backbones and training strategies. MMSegmentation is useful in quantitative fields like medical imaging where _precise_ pixel-level classification is crucial.
