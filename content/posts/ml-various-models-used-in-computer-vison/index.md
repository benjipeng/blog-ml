# An in-Depth Look at Leading Computer Vision ML Models

As computer vision continues to evolve, understanding the various machine learning models driving this technology is crucial. We explore the most impactful models, highlighting key innovations.

## Stacked Hourglass Networks

Stacked Hourglass Networks are introduced by Newell et al. in [Stacked Hourglass Networks for Human Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.06937v2)

## DeepPose

The DeepPose paper [DeepPose: Human Pose Estimation via Deep Neural Networks](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/1312.4659), published by Google researchers at **_CVPR_** (`Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition`) in 2014. DeepPose was a pioneering approach at that time to _human pose estimation_ using Deep Neural Networks (DNNs).

> The core idea of the paper is to frame pose estimation as a DNN-based regression problem, predicting the coordinates of body joints `directly` from images (instead of treating it like a **_traditional_** classification methods)

The method proposed a cascade of DNN regressors to _iteratively_ refine pose predictions, starting with a _rough estimate_ and improving it through _successive stages_.
