The healthcare landscape is undergoing a profound transformation since the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs). These advanced ML-driven tools, such as OpenAI’s GPT-4, are reshaping medical practice, research, and education. LLMs generate human-like text after analyzing vast amounts of text data, offering unprecedented opportunities to enhance diagnosis, personalize treatment, and accelerate scientific discovery. Nevertheless, integrating LLMs into clinical settings presents unique challenges and ethical considerations.

Large language models (LLMs) can respond to free-text queries without being specifically trained in the task in question.
