# Power of Multimodal Machine Learning: Challenges, Innovations, and Future Directions

## Intro

Multimodal machine learning combines different types of data, mimicking human perception. This approach is being applied in healthcare, robotics, and multimedia, where diverse information must be processed. Challenges has been faced by researchers in integrating various data types, as models are required to handle different inputs while maintaining coherence. Despite difficulties, multimodal learning's potential in areas like autonomous driving[^Xiao et al., 2020] and human-computer interaction[^Muhammad et al., 2021] has been widely recognized.

Huge credit to [Liang et al., 2022](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2209.03430), a lot of figures are from (except for noted elsewhere)[^Liang et al., 2022]

Rapid advancements in multimodal research have created challenges in:

- Recognizing consistent patterns across past and current studies.
- Identifying the fundamental unresolved issues in this area of study.

## Multimodal Research

_Modality_ refers to a way in which a natural phenomenon is perceived or expressed. _Multimodal_ has multiple involved modalities. Modalities sits along a spectrum from raw (closer to a sensor) to abstract (further away from sensors, down the data processing pipelines). In a multimodal computational study, each entity is _heterogeneous_ but _interconnected_.

### Representation

Representation is about combining different types of data. Are heterogeneity and interconnections learnable during the process?

- **Representation Fusion**: Mixing information from different sources, effectively reducing separate representation.
- **Representation Coordination**: Swapping information between sources to improve understanding
- **Representation Fission**: Breaking down information into smaller, separate parts

### Alignment

Alignment is about finding connections between different types of modality elements.

- **Discrete Alignment**: Linking specific pieces of (discrete) data and identify their connections.
- **Continuous Alignment**: For modality elements are **_NOT_** already segmented and discretized, methods based on `warping` and `segmentation` have been proposed.
- **Contextualized Representations**: Learning how different types of data interact to obtain better representations.

### Reasoning

Reasoning means composing knowledge and using information to solve problems, likely through multiple inferential steps.

- **Structure Modeling**: Understanding how the problem is set up and how the reasoning occurs.
- **Intermediate Concepts**: Breaking the problem into steps.
- **Inference Paradigms**: Figuring out how to reach conclusions (abstract concepts are inferred from individual multimodal evidence).
- **External Knowledge**: Using outside information to help.

### Generation

This means creating new data (raw modalities) through a generative process.

- **Summarization**: Summing up important points from lots of data.
- **Translation**: Changing data from one type to another.
- **Creation**: Making new data that fits together well.

### Transference

This is about knowledge transfer, from one type of modality to help with another.

![transference](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2209.03430/assets/x16.png)

- **Cross-modal transfer**: Using what we know about one type of data to understand another. _Readily available_ labeled or unlabeled data is used in secondary modalities to develop robust models. These models are then adapted or fine-tuned for tasks involving the primary modality, effectively transferring knowledge across different data types.
- **Multimodal Co-learning**: Sharing information between different types of data by sharing intermediate representation spaces between both modalities.
- **Model Induction**: Keeping different types of data/training _separate_ but still sharing information (Model induction uses separate algorithms for different data views. Each algorithm's results help label new data for the other view, expanding its training set. This transfers information across views through predictions, not shared spaces.)

### Quantification

Studying how all of above works by _empirical_ and _theoretical_ analysis of multimodal models. This study aims to enhance understanding, leading to improvements in model robustness, interpretability, and real-world reliability.

- **Dimensions of Heterogeneity**: How different types of data are unique (understand the dimensions of heterogeneity)
- **Modality Interconnections**: How different types of data connect and interact
- **Multimodal Learning Process**: The challenges of working with **_heterogeneous_** data

#### Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM)

The Class Activation Mapping (CAM) approach [CVPR 2016] modifies image classification CNN architectures by replacing fully-connected (FC) layers with convolutional layers and global average pooling to achieve class-specific feature maps.

![GradCAM overview](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/1610.02391/assets/figures/Grad-CAM_approach.png "Grad-CAM overview")

[ICCV 2017](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/1610.02391), Grad-CAM uses gradients of _any_ target concept (i.e. ‘dog’ in a classification network or a sequence of words in captioning network) flowing into the final convolutional layer to produce a coarse localization map highlighting the important regions in the image for predicting the concept[^Ramprasaath et. al., 2017]. Grad-CAM uses the gradient information flowing into the last convolutional layer of the CNN to assign importance values to each neuron for a particular decision of interest.
